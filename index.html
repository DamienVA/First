    <h2>Something About Him</h2>
    <p>The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) is the largest carnivorous mammal on the island of Madagascar. They can reach
        nearly six feet in length, with half of that due to their long tails. They look like a cross between a cat, a
        dog, and a mongoose. Fossas have slender bodies, muscular limbs, and short, reddish-brown coats.</p>
